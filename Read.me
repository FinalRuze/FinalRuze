Im working on a project called SystemBlackout.exe while in the works of learning how to code. Which i don't know how to yet but im getting there xd

SystemBlackout V1 is out and its only made out of vbs scripting ðŸ˜…

SystemBlackout V2 is in the works and will be using powershell, batch, and vbs scripting to make it a tiny bit better.

SystemBlackout V3 soon...
